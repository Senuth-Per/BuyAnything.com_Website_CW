        <h2> Senuth Perera(Student 3)</h2>

        <p>I'm Senuth Perera, The product page is designed to offer a seamless online shopping experience. It features distinct 
            sections for managing carts and browsing products, ensuring a smooth flow. HTML structures the page and includes a 
            form for user information, while JavaScript adds interactivity by verifying details, copying product information as items 
            are added to carts, calculating prices, and more. CSS enhances the visual appeal by adjusting fonts, colors, and layouts. 
            Overall, the page leverages HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to deliver a straightforward and visually pleasing shopping experience.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile,
            in the "About Us" section, the page is organized with HTML. CSS is used to create hover effects and style the fonts and layout. 
            JavaScript adds interactivity, such as revealing details when hovering over team member cards and allowing font size changes 
            with zoom buttons (+ and -). Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript collaborate to deliver an engaging and informative "About Us" 
            experience.</p>
