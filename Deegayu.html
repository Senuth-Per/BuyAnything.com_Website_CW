        <h2> Deegayu Mihiraj(Student 2)</h2>

        <p>I'm Deegayu Mihiraj, To design the form on the page, I utilized HTML form elements and incorporated JavaScript to implement 
            the form's functionality, ensuring that actions were executed when the form was clicked. Additionally, CSS was employed 
            to enhance the page's appearance and give it a more professional look.</p>
        <p>For creating the quiz page, I primarily used HTML and CSS to design the placeholder elements of the quiz. I then implemented
             a simple JavaScript logic to swap questions and answers using a two-dimensional array.
             In designing the home page, I focused heavily on CSS to improve its aesthetics. A small amount of JavaScript was also used 
             to cache user details, allowing this information to be displayed in the top right corner of the page when needed.</p>
